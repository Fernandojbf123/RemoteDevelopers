# RemoteDevelopers
Project one for this team of Remote Developers will be an aid for gluten-free consumers. Still in planning stages to not much more other than the tech. We will be using the MERN stack with Python to implement some ML and AI. Interested in joining the team? Contact [Jon Christie](jonchristie.net) and he will kindly get you setup and onboard!
